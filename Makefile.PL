    ****************************************************************
    I am unable to load the core module "$module". You must install
    $module and then try installing Email::Fingerprint again.  Your
    Perl installation should have included these modules, so if
    they're missing it suggests:

    1) Something might be very wrong, or
    2) You might be using too old a Perl version, or
    3) Your Perl package was intentionally crippled[*]

    [*] RedHat and derivatives, I'm talking about YOU.

    Sorry for any inconvenience!
