Email-Fingerprint

Email::Fingerprint provides methods for generating checksums for
email messages. Depending on the options chosen, the checksum can

can use this module to detect duplicate email messages, even if the
messages differ in some headers--for example, if they were relayed
through different SMTP servers or sent at different times.
