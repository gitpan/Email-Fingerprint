Email-Fingerprint

Email::Fingerprint provides methods for generating checksums for
email messages. Depending on the options chosen, the checksum can
include the body only or the body and select RFC822 headers. Scripts
can use this module to detect duplicate email messages, even if the
messages differ in some headers--for example, if they were relayed
through different SMTP servers or sent at different times.

REQUIREMENTS

Installation requires Perl version 5.006 or greater: version 5.005005
has a bug which prevents it from parsing the Makefile.PL correctly.

The architecture must support the UNIX epoch, 00:00:00 GMT, January
1, 1970.  If Perl's time() function uses a non-standard epoch, some
tests will fail.  The module should still work fine, however.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
